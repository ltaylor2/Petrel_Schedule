Computational model system for analyzing the behavior and reproduction of seabird pair-bonds. Currently hosts code analyzing the energetics and schedules of two storm-petrel parents and an egg across the incubation season. Currently parameterized for Leach's Storm-Petrels (<i>Hydrobates leucorhous</i>) in the Northwest Atlantic.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
The C++ source code is compiled in <code>src/</code> with <code>make</code>
<br><br>
In the <code>src/</code> directory, run the compiled program with <code>./lhsp</code>
<br>
Important user/testing settings are found at the top of <code>src/main.cpp</code>
<br>
Simulation output (big file) is written to <code>Output/</code> directory
<br>
An example slurm script (for running simulations on HPC) is provided in <code>lhsp.sh</code>
<br><br>
Process the simulation output in chunks with <code>R/process_simulation_results.r</code>
<br>
Processed output is written as a separate file (<code>Output/processed_results.csv</code>)
<br><br>
Analyze results with <code>R/analysis.r</code>
<br>
Descriptive statistics logged in <code>Output/</code>
<br>
Plot images saved to <code>Plots</code>
